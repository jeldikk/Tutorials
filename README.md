# Philosophy of a programming language

Welcome to a repository of life long commits-ment. I am a self taught programmer, who believes that organised way of learning with qualitative problem practice is key to learning any programming language. since, me, extensively using tools or languages contributed by many generous people in open-source community. I thought its my turn to give it back to the people, by sharing the knowledge I have gained while teaching myself how to program an algorithm.

## Introduction - ABC of any programming language

Let's be there cheering for all the great people who have kept their passionate efforts in making up the technology which we will be forever the same. 'same' in the sense, it just as it is before and after but, it is just changing shape from bigger vaccume-tube switch to micro-size MOS switch. it shifted from a huge picture-tube based TV to high-definition wall mountable LED TV and even to a hand held mobile phone. In order to cater with this technology changes many programming languages are invented to satisfy the demanding technology features, some include like processing, system level control, good memory management and a contributed code base for some advance operations.

So before getting into the discussion, let us just think why it has to be 'language'.? why not something like 'principles'? 'guidelines'? 'rules'?.. so this gives a clue that the way we learn a programming language is not similar to what we think of gaining knowledge about an activity, but the strateges used while learning any verbal language are also applicable to learn any programming language. if you just enumerate how we learnt spoken languages at school..!! Initially we were taught _alphabet letters_ (A B C ...), later we were taught the art of making _Words_ by grouping these letters ( CODE from C, D, E, O), later we were taught _patterns_ of using these words to make sentences. someone with a proficiency about the language can create  _poems_ using these sentences by arranging words in some patterns. during the course of this language skill development, If we observe carefully these _letters_, _words_ and _patterns_ make the building blocks of a language. Different spoken languages have their own letters, words and pattern that form up the language. One should hard wire these letters, words and patters subconsciously in order to master that language. Just like we use verbal languages in order to communicate with someone who is familiar with the language, we use programming languages to communicate with the computer and make it do what is needed( like singing, playing videos, mathematical computation etc., ) 

Analogous to the above discussion, every programming language has its own basic building elements, keywords and patterns( which other wise called as semantics ) to be followed
